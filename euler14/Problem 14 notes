n--> n/2 (n is even)
n --> 3n+1 (n is odd)

Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?

NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.

Chains seem to be duplicated, but at first glance saving the number and chain amount does not seem to be the
best approach.
